	The mountains are calling and I must go.<br>We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; 
	and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence<br>
	Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth.
	Our task must be to free ourselves…by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty.<br>
	When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet most of the audience still sleeps.

	So if we’re sympathetic to the idea that nature, or aspects of it, are beautiful, we might ask ourselves why we experience nature in this way. 
	Emerson says that nature is beautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive. 
	In nature we observe growth and development in living things, contrasted with the static or deteriorating state of the vast majority of that which is man-made.
	More generally, he writes:  “We ascribe beauty to that which…has no superfluous parts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all things”. 
	He cites natural structures as lacking superfluities, an observation that in general has been confirmed by the advancement of biology.
	Furthermore, he says that whether talking about a human artifact or a natural organism, any increase of ability to achieve its end or goal is an increase in beauty.
	s an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. 
	Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. 
	They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, 
	the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. 
	Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

	I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; 
	and perhaps it says 'Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.
